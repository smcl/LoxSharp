# LoxSharp

My version of the AST-walk interpreter from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) but written in C# instead of Java. Still in-progress.

TODO:
- implement a few more builtins/libs
- write a C# FFI
- implement anonymous/lambda functions
- arrays and/or tuples
- list comprehensions?
